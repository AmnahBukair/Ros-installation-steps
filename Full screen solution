to solve this problem: 
Device >> Insert Guest Addition CD image
the problem i faced is that, the guest CD was already intalled.
The massege:
Unable to insert the virtual optical disk C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\VBoxGuestAdditions.iso into the machine ub2. Could not mount the media/drive 'C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\VBoxGuestAdditions.iso' (VERR_PDM_MEDIA_LOCKED). Result Code: E_FAIL (0x80004005) Component: ConsoleWrap Interface: IConsole {872da645-4a9b-1727-bee2-5585105b9eed} Callee: IMachine {85632c68-b5bb-4316-a900-5eb28d3413df}

so i went to setting and remove the gust CD and Restart ubuntu again.
Now i was able to install guest CD, entered password and then installation will begin.
after that i close ubunta and VM. 
Next time i run ubuntu, Full screen was done Corectlly!
